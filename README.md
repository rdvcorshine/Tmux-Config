# Tmux-Config
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time.\

**USAGE:**\
- sudo apt install tmux
- go to your ~/ and touch **.tmux.conf**
  - if you have **.tmux.conf** skip this part
- copy your own config to another folder *if you have*
- copy this script to your **.tmux.conf**
- launch by typing ***tmux new -s "corshine"** # without quotation marks
  - prefix + d will deattach the tmux
  - simply type **tmux attach -t "corshine"** to attach back where you were. # without quotation marks
